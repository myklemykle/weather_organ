Weather Organ is a [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/) instrument for manipulating sparse noise to imitate slowly-changing natural sound sources 
such as rain, wind, surf, fire, Geiger counters and volcanic activity, and to create interesting new textures of sound.  
It is the product of various discoveries made while using Faust to explore the definition, synthesis and experience of 
acoustic noise while, simultaneously using the exploration of noise as as focus for learning Faust.

I wrote a paper about it: [__Weather Organ: A sparse stochastic synthesizer in Faust__](weatherorgan.pdf).

Weather Organ is somewhat heavyweight for a Faust program, but has been tested to run under [FaustLive](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faustlive),
and can compile to an OS X binary with [faust2caqt](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/aspf/FAUST_Examples.html), or with the [Faust Online Compiler](https://faust.grame.fr/onlinecompiler/).  

Please do use this project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/myklemykle/weather_organ/issues) to let me know if you hit any problems.  Thanks!
